# Green Thumb Information Technology Manifesto

***By: [IT Almanac Insights](index.md) - "Harvesting the Power of Information Technology"***

## Green Thumb Values

1. **We value a clear chain of command over open team collaboration.**
   - Just as a Farm Manager directs the work of field hands, we prioritize a structured hierarchy over spontaneous teamwork.

2. **We value the harvested information over the systems that collect it.**
   - The value lies in the data and insights we gather, not in the specific systems or tools used to collect them.

3. **We value focused, uninterrupted work over frequent check-ins and meetings.**
   - Similar to how a Crop Scout surveys fields without distraction, we emphasize deep work over constant status updates.

4. **We value delivering on time and within budget over adjusting plans mid-season.**
   - Much like harvesting crops at their peak, we focus on meeting deadlines and budgets rather than making changes during the project.

5. **We value detailed documentation post-harvest over real-time note-taking.**
   - Similar to recording yields after the season, we prioritize documenting changes and learnings after the project is complete rather than during.

## Green Thumb Principles
 

### **Principle: Stick with Reliable Equipment**

Just as a farmer trusts a well-maintained tractor to get the job done efficiently, we prioritize using proven tools and solutions over inventing new ones. By relying on reliable equipment, we ensure productivity and avoid unnecessary complications.

### **Principle: No Lone Cowboys in the Fields**

Just as a successful farm depends on the coordinated efforts of the entire team, we emphasize working together to stay on time and within budget. A renegade approach, where one person takes unnecessary risks, can lead to delays and failed crops. We believe that staying aligned as a unit is key to delivering consistent results.

### **Principle: Scare Off Disruptions**

Just as a scarecrow keeps pests away from the crops, we protect the team from unnecessary client interference, allowing them to focus on their work. By minimizing disruptions during the growing season, we ensure that our laborers can cultivate their tasks without being derailed by constant interruptions.

### **Principle: Minimize Unnecessary Watering**

Just as overwatering can drown plants, excessive meetings can overwhelm a project. We believe in giving the team the right amount of guidance and oversight, allowing them to thrive without being bogged down by too many check-ins or updates.


### **Principle: Harvest First, Document Minimally**

Just as a farmer focuses on bringing in the harvest before addressing detailed records, we prioritize completing the project and creating only minimal documentation afterward. This approach ensures that essential tasks are completed efficiently, with documentation kept to the necessary minimum to capture key insights without overburdening the process.

### **Principle: Celebrate and Reflect**

Just as a farmer celebrates the harvest with a festival, we focus on documenting and reflecting positively on our project successes after completion. This celebration allows us to acknowledge achievements and learn from the experience, ensuring that our reflections are constructive and celebratory.


### **Principle: Centralize Decision-Making**

Just as a Farm Manager makes all major decisions to streamline farm operations, we value a clear chain of command over committee-based decisions. Relying on a single decision-maker ensures efficiency and consistency, avoiding the delays and inefficiencies that can arise from multiple committee inputs.

### **Principle: Designate the Lead Gardener**

Just as a lead gardener oversees the entire garden to ensure uniform growth and care, we rely on designated leaders to handle client interactions and project oversight. By centralizing these responsibilities, we avoid scattered efforts and ensure that all project aspects are managed coherently and effectively.


### **Principle: Methods Flexible, Outcomes Firm**

Just as farm laborers have the freedom to choose their methods to ensure crops are delivered on time and within budget, we allow team members flexibility in their approaches as long as they meet the project's deadlines and budget constraints. The focus remains on achieving the end result efficiently, regardless of the specific methods used.


### **Principle: Prioritize Timely Harvest Over Perfect Yield**

Just as a farmer might accept a less-than-perfect crop to stay within budget and meet harvest deadlines, we are willing to compromise on certain aspects of quality to ensure projects are completed on time and within financial constraints. Delivering on schedule and within budget takes precedence over achieving the perfect outcome.
